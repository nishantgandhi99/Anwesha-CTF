# Follow these steps to generate a patch that can be merged by committer:

- Check out the Anwesha-CTF source from the git repository.

- Create a new issue in project repository if there is not one for patch.

- Make the changes necessary for your particular issue while following the code conventions found in CODE_CONVENTIONS. Try to avoid unnecessary changes, such as extra whitespace or formatting changes. 

- You can create direct pull request on Github Project repository. The contributor/committer can review and merge the patch in project repository source code.

- You can also generate a patch with diff. For subsequent patches, if necessary, number each version to make it easier for reviewers to track their progress.Upload your diff to any review board and invite committer for review. A committer should review the patch shortly and either provide feedback for a new version, or commit it to the Anwesha-CTF source.
